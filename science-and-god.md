# Science was never against God

This might sound very weird, but I think that we don’t have enough evidence to reject the existence of God.

To be fair, the Bible also does *not* prove that God exists, or rather, it is the least convincing way of proving that there is God.

However, as I have said to my friends and family multiple times, just because something doesn’t make sense in the way that we perceive the world doesn’t imply that it’s impossible.

For instance, let’s say that you pick up an ant and put it down in a very far place, or tear a hole through a paper and let it walk to the other side, I think that seems fairly impossible enough for the ants, but what about us humans? We live in a three-dimensional world, where we can freely move anywhere we want, but with a very limited control of other elements of the universe, especially time. Technically, we also do not have enough evidence to reject that we live in a simulation or no creature lives in a higher dimension. Let’s talk about a creature who lives in a fourth-dimensional world; it can theoretically walk through time just like how we can walk across the room. Time is a space that it can control. Suppose that this creature visits us on Earth one day and just walks across *its room,* that’s easily convincing enough for humans to call it a miracle.

Whether God showed the miracle to us or not is a little bit irrelevant here, since there is no way to go back and prove it.

I just want to make a point that, even the theory of evolution, or the theory of the Big Bang does not imply that no creature is watching us from a higher-dimensional world.

In statistics, if you do not have enough evidence, you would not risk yourself rejecting the Null Hypothesis—in this case, that there is God—because you could commit the Type I error (rejecting the truth,) which is a waste of opportunity to exploit what we already have. We would, for example, lose a chance to research how God can communicate with some group of people and not the other through a medium that is faster than any technology we have. Also, there is no harm in holding on to the null hypothesis that we have until we can find enough evidence to reject it. It is rather beneficial for everybody to start finding a truth, that even though God didn’t exist in the end, we get to put some work into finding more knowledge and cultivating our wisdom, which I think is something valuable.
